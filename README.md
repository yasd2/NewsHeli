### Official download on lcpdfr.com: https://www.lcpdfr.com/downloads/gta5mods/scripts/51090-newsheli/
NewsHeli adds a news helicopter to police pursuits. By default, it joins the chase 30 seconds after the pursuit starts (this delay is fully customizable).

Optional custom dispatch sounds can play when the helicopter arrives and when the pursuit ends.

A news van is also available (toggleable), which follows the suspect’s vehicle about 40 seconds into the pursuit (also customizable).
 

The INI file allows you to configure these key settings.
The XML file lets you customize which vehicles and peds are used.
 

NewsHeli is a remastered version of NewsHeliPursuit by Albo, with the goal to:
- make it open-source https://github.com/yasd2/NewsHeli
- offer greater customization
- include more features


## HeliView - a side feature enables a gta news camera! - NEW!

With a keypress you can toggle this camera and follow the chase from the view of a helicopter! Definitely worth checking out!
You can choose the camera type between police, news style or random.
You can customize the appearing text with the news overlay.

You can also jump between different suspects. Make sense if one is running on foot and another speeding in a vehicle.

NewsHeli adds a news helicopter to police pursuits. By default, it joins the chase 30 seconds after the pursuit starts (this delay is fully customizable).

Optional custom dispatch sounds can play when the helicopter arrives and when the pursuit ends.

A news van is also available (toggleable), which follows the suspect’s vehicle about 40 seconds into the pursuit (also customizable).
 

The INI file allows you to configure these key settings.
The XML file lets you customize which vehicles and peds are used.
 

NewsHeli is a remastered version of NewsHeliPursuit by Albo, with the goal to:
- make it open-source https://github.com/yasd2/NewsHeli
- offer greater customization
- include more features
